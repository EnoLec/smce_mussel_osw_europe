This repository contains the data used in the paper titled "Identifying suitable mussel cultivation sites in European offshore waters – an assessment for co-location with the wind industry" (currently under review). 

You will find here the data used in a spatial multi-criteria evaluation to identify suitable areas in european offshore waters for mussel (Mytilus edulis) cultivation. Also, OSW data were used to find overlapping regions for potential co-location activities.

This repository is still a work in progress and its purpose is to complement the paper by helping to replicate the results or to adapt the workflow to another region or species.
