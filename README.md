This repository contains the data used in the paper titled "Identifying suitable mussel cultivation sites in European offshore waters – an assessment for co-location with the wind industry" (currently under review). 

You will find here the data used in a spatial multi-criteria evaluation to identify suitable areas in european offshore waters for mussel (Mytilus edulis) cultivation. Also, OSW data were used to find overlapping regions for potential co-location activities.

This repository is still a work in progress and its purpose is to complement the paper by helping to replicate the results or to adapt the workflow to another region or species. 

The flowchart below can be used for more information on the methods:
